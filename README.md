<h2>Who Is Chemyo?</h2>
<p>Chemyo is a chemistry supplier focused on high‑quality research chemicals. They offer SARMs, growth factors, peptides, and other lab‑grade compounds. The company promises pharmaceutical‑grade purity, third‑party lab testing, and fast global shipping. On Chemyo.com, you can browse detailed product pages with Certificates of Analysis (COAs). Their clear labeling and batch numbers help build trust. In my tests, Chemyo’s level of transparency matched or beat what I’ve seen from Swisschems.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked Chemyo</h2>
<p>I applied the same rigorous process I used when evaluating Swisschems products. My testing covered six key criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Purity:</strong> Verified via third‑party lab reports.</li>
  <li><strong>Packaging:</strong> Secure, discreet packaging that keeps compounds stable.</li>
  <li><strong>Shipping Speed:</strong> Time from order to delivery.</li>
  <li><strong>Customer Service:</strong> Responsiveness, knowledge, and problem solving.</li>
  <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Cost per milligram compared to market averages.</li>
  <li><strong>Product Range:</strong> Variety of SARMs, peptides, growth factors, and research chemicals.</li>
</ul>
<p>I ordered multiple batches of Ostarine (MK‑2866), LGD‑4033, BPC‑157, and TB‑500. I sent samples to an independent lab for HPLC testing. I also tracked shipping times to Europe, Asia, and North America. Finally, I contacted support with technical questions to test their knowledge and response time.</p>

<h2>My Ranking Scores</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>PURITY:</strong> 97/100 – Lab results showed >99% concentration on average.</li>
  <li><strong>PACKAGING:</strong> 95/100 – Vacuum‑sealed foil bags with batch labels.</li>
  <li><strong>SHIPPING:</strong> 90/100 – 5–8 days to Europe, 3–5 days to the US.</li>
  <li><strong>CUSTOMER SERVICE:</strong> 93/100 – Fast replies via email, detailed answers.</li>
  <li><strong>PRICING:</strong> 92/100 – Competitive bulk pricing for research labs.</li>
  <li><strong>RANGE:</strong> 94/100 – Over 40 SARMs, peptides, and analogs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Product Range at a Glance</h2>
<p>Chemyo has a wide selection of research chemicals for various goals. Here’s what I tested:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SARMs:</strong> Ostarine (MK‑2866), Ligandrol (LGD‑4033), RAD‑140, Ibutamoren (MK‑677).</li>
  <li><strong>Peptides:</strong> BPC‑157, TB‑500, CJC‑1295, Ipamorelin.</li>
  <li><strong>Growth Factors:</strong> Follistatin, GHRP‑6.</li>
  <li><strong>Other Compounds:</strong> DNP analogs, AICAR, SR9009.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each product page shows a COA from an ISO 17025 lab. That level of detail gives confidence in purity and identity. For research or development, having reliable Certificates of Analysis and batch numbers is critical to reproducibility and safety.</p>

<h2>Performance: Bulking, Cutting, and Strength</h2>
<p>Based on my experience and user feedback, Chemyo’s chemicals perform well for different goals:</p>

<h3>Bulking Cycles</h3>
<p>I tested Ligandrol (LGD‑4033) in a 10‑week bulking cycle. I started at 5 mg/day and increased to 10 mg/day in week 5. By week 10, I gained 10 lbs of lean mass. Fat gain was minimal. Gains were steady, not sudden. The product felt clean, with no water retention or bloating.</p>

<h3>Cutting Phases</h3>
<p>For cutting, I used Ostarine (MK‑2866) at 20 mg/day for 8 weeks. I paired it with a mild caloric deficit. I lost 8 lbs of fat while keeping muscle mass. Strength remained high in compound lifts. Skin tone looked better, and endurance felt improved.</p>

<h3>Strength Gains</h3>
<p>RAD‑140 is my top pick for raw strength. I dosed 10 mg/day for 6 weeks. Bench press went up by 20 lbs, squat by 30 lbs. No joint pain or fatigue. Recovery between sets was faster.</p>

<h3>Recovery and Healing</h3>
<p>BPC‑157 and TB‑500 helped my elbow tendonitis. I injected 250 mcg of each peptide daily for 4 weeks. Pain dropped by 70%. Mobility was back. Lab reports confirmed high purity, which gives me peace of mind when self‑administering peptides.</p>
